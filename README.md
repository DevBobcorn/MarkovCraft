# MarkovCraft
[MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) brought into Unity, with additional exporting funtionalities for Minecraft.

## > About
*MarkovCraft* is a Unity port of [MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior). Unity's new ECS system enables *MarkovCraft* to render model generation process in realtime, with considerable performance. This app provides a more user-friendly graphical interface, making it easier to create, view, run and export MarkovJunior models.

## > Building & Running
The program is made and tested with Unity 2022.3.26f1, so it is recommended to use this version of Unity(or a newer version) to build this app.

## > Localization
*English (en)* and *Simplified Chinese (zh-Hans)* locales are currently available. Support for other languages might be added later.
